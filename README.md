Incremental learning for random forest algorithm. It learns at every run instead of rebuilding. Detailed flow of this process is explained [here](https://github.com/kartheekpnsn/rf-incremental-learning/blob/master/Incremental.pptx)

Run using:
```
Rscript 0-run-this.R
```

Once you are done running. Check logs in the 'logs' folder to assess the performance.
